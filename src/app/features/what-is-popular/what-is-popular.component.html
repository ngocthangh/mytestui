The remaining survivors built a city within extremely high walls to stay alive and there they were safe for over a hundred years. But out of nowhere, a Colossal Titan emerges again and attacks the city! It is up to Eren, Mikasa, Erwin, Levi, Hanji, Sasha, Armin, and the rest of the squad to keep the city safe and fend off the Titans. Also, will they ever find out whatâ€™s in that basement?</h5>

During 124 sold-out shows in arenas around the world, the constant camera presence creates both a front-row seat and a backstage pass as Perry performs for thousands of fans, then returns to the reality of her everyday life.
